I was looking to experiment a little bit with dynamically placing images on a webpage (i.e. drag-and-drops, rotating & scaling images).
At the same time, I figured it would also be fun to add some canvas elements where users could make their own paintings.

The images themselves were all taken from https://www.heritagetype.com/pages/free-vintage-illustrations.
